### Instructions

We have to code a function `fizzBuzz(numberArray)` that takes a an array of integers `numberArray`. The function loops through each integer such that it returns integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5. The output should be given in an array.
